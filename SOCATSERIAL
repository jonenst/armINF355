EXAMPLE FOR REMOTE TTY (TTY OVER TCP) USING SOCAT

You have a host with some serial device like a modem or a bluetooth interface
(modem server)
You want to make use of this device on a different host. (client)

1) on the modem server start a process that accepts network connections and
links them with the serial device /dev/tty0:

$ socat tcp-l:54321,reuseaddr,fork file:/dev/tty0,nonblock,waitlock=/var/run/tty0.lock

2) on the client start a process that creates a pseudo tty and links it with a
tcp connection to the modem server:

$ socat pty,link=$HOME/dev/vmodem0,waitslave tcp:modem-server:54321


sudo socat tcp-l:54321,reuseaddr,fork file:/dev/ttyUSB0,nonblock,waitlock=/var/run/ttyUSB0.lock
